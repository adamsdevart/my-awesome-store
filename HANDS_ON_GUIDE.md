## 🏗️ Phase 1: Project Foundation & Architecture

### Step 1: Create Your New Project

**What we're doing:** Starting fresh with a modern, scalable architecture.

**Create a new project:**
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-awesome-store -- --template react
cd my-awesome-store
npm install
```

**Install the foundation packages:**
```bash
npm install react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
npm install zustand immer
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install -D @types/node
```

**Why these packages?**
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool
- **React Query**: Professional data fetching and caching
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth, professional animations
- **Zustand**: Lightweight, powerful state management
- **Tailwind**: Rapid, consistent styling

### Step 2: Set Up Professional Project Structure

**Create this folder structure:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components
│   ├── features/     # Feature-specific components
│   └── common/       # Shared components
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
├── stores/           # State management
├── services/         # API and external services
├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── types/            # TypeScript definitions
├── styles/           # Global styles
├── pages/            # Page components
├── lib/              # Third-party library configs
└── constants/        # App constants
```

**Your challenge:** Create this structure and think about why we organize it this way.

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

**Initialize Tailwind:**
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

**Configure `tailwind.config.js`:**
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          50: '#eff6ff',
          500: '#3b82f6',
          600: '#2563eb',
          700: '#1d4ed8',
        },
        secondary: {
          50: '#f8fafc',
          500: '#64748b',
          600: '#475569',
        }
      },
      animation: {
        'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out',
        'slide-up': 'slideUp 0.3s ease-out',
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**Why Tailwind?**
- Rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Easy responsive design

## 🛍️ Phase 2: Core E-Commerce Features

### Step 4: Design Your Data Architecture

**What we're doing:** Planning a scalable data structure that can handle real e-commerce complexity.

**Design your product data model:**
```js
// Think about what a real e-commerce product needs:
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  price: number,
  comparePrice?: number,  // For showing "was $X, now $Y"
  images: string[],
  variants: ProductVariant[],  // Size, color, etc.
  categories: string[],
  tags: string[],
  inventory: {
    inStock: boolean,
    quantity: number,
    lowStockThreshold: number
  },
  ratings: {
    average: number,
    count: number,
    reviews: Review[]
  },
  shipping: {
    weight: number,
    dimensions: Dimensions,
    freeShipping: boolean
  }
}
```

**Your challenge:** Design your own data models. Consider:

import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'

export const useCartStore = create(
  persist(
    immer((set, get) => ({
      items: [],
      addItem: (product, variant, quantity) => {
        set((state) => {
          // Your cart logic here
        })
      },
      // More cart methods...
    })),
    {
      name: 'cart-storage',
    }
  )
)
```

**Create `src/components/features/cart/CartDrawer.jsx`:**
- Slide-out cart that doesn't interrupt shopping

const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      whileHover={{ y: -5 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      {/* Your product card content */}
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

**Your challenge:** Add animations that enhance UX. Think about:

### Step 11: Integrate GTM & GA4

**What we're doing:** Setting up comprehensive analytics to track user behavior and conversions.

**Create `src/services/analytics.js`:**
```js
export const analytics = {
  trackPageView: (page) => {
    // GTM/GA4 page view tracking
  },
  trackProductView: (product) => {
    // Product impression tracking
  },
  trackAddToCart: (product, quantity) => {
    // Add to cart event
  },
  trackPurchase: (order) => {
    // Purchase conversion tracking
  },
  trackUserJourney: (action, details) => {
    // Custom event tracking
  }
}
```

**Track key events:**
